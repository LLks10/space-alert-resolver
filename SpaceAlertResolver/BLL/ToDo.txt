DI notes:
Threats:
  currently have time appears, zone (if applicable) and bonus threat (if applicable) set as props
  currently have threat controller and sitting duck set in initialize


To add animations:
add DI
add snapshot collector - inject it, make singleton per app (try a simple website test first)
add a different kind of event for sub-event
add state for anything to track, i.e. shield draining, gun firing, losing health, taking damage, etc
add server-side compression
fire new events for all state
update client to handle new sub-states:
  by default, just run through them silently
  add option to view sub-events

move to azure? find another host?

//TODO: Code Cleanup: Make damage an event
//TODO: Rules clarification: Does a person heroically moving occupy the lift?
//TODO: Code Cleanup: Make reusable threat 'components', Extract more common behavior to base and/or impl - such as shield killed by pulse, retaliate against battle bots, etc
//TODO: Code Cleanup: Change energy from int to actual blocks?
//TODO: Code Cleanup: Change all the PlayerDamage[] to IList<PlayerDamage> or IEnumerable<PlayerDamage> because what was i thinking.
//TODO: Unit test pulse cannon and laser cannon

//TODO: Code Cleanup: Change all mechanic buff removals to be event-based, and always fire 'tried to use cannon' event
//TODO: Code Cleanup: Revisit construction and threatcontroller -> game -> sittingduck -> threats dependency graph
//TODO: Double actions and Specializations: Change move-out to only fire before an 'turn' that has a movement and move-in to only fire after
//TODO: Bug: Make sure all places that set a players station set it in that station too.
//TODO: Make sure that all knocked out also disables battlebots if medic prevents knockout (and make sure spec ops behaves around parasite correctly)
//TODO: Advanced Spec ops (can't be delayed, respect HasSpecialOpsProtection on that turn)
//TODO: Code cleanup: Remove threat controller from all implementations of threats - make methods on Threat that subscribe to everything they care about



bug: delay from double action first part - should delay 2nd part and it's not
bug: delay from double action second part - moving second part to next spot and repeating it
bug: delay from double action second part isn't protected by spec ops
TODO: Change slime impl - add ThreatGroups

https://craig.is/killing/mice

add ability to go from text to input (instead of from text to resolution)
changes in progress on work laptop:
  1. add what you need in order to resolve
  2. fix slime points
  3. change input to use arrow keys, display as font awesome arrows
when manually entering or going back, make things that are done via watches work properly
when manually entering, make 5th player (maybe < 4 players too) and campaign damage work
on manual entry, remove extra button presses

allow left/right/up/down, use fontawesome assets, allow backspace


make assets smaller
make mobile/alt screen resolution friendly
allow 4+ threats in track - scroll? collapse?
show message when can't go to resolution page - saying why
fix bonus threats time appears
fix bonus threats time appears collision
switch to CDN?
bug: using back button, tracks don't detect already used tracks
tweak loading screen
hide spoilers
advanced spec ops - protect from change decks from space-time vortex, check for any other things
add 'feature request?'
show 'tried to fire but no energy' and 'fired at nothing'
feature: show turn 13 separately
feature: allow entering tracks by number
fix navbar menu selected items - why does #/ vs # work, and when should selection change?
disabled battlebots
accordian
dropdown for threats
make left and right arrows move cursor? or ctrl-shift->?
specializations:
teleporter - allow setting teleport tokens
weird impl - can change spec and set a different spec card, and it will not do it correctly (pick basic energy tech, then change spec, on another turn choose new spec, will perform new one twice instead of energy)
future: support for variant where you can use different specs
rename 'description' where it's filename to filename, action model needs filename, displaytext, hotkey, 
if changing 'blank' to space instead of dash - find out what the ? menu shows for that

QoL:
player actions on resolution enhancesments:
  make bigger?
  show 'was performed' by opacity?


get enums to client with client-usable name, id, and display string
fix scrolling when auto-resolving


  scout attack buff
  threats on all 3 tracks
  show parasite on player?


switch threat-on-ship lines to instead grey out other sections of the ship when hovering over a threat
change threat-on-track lines to something else?
threat with multiple stations - lines broken

damage - allow user to either have app choose or have client choose, and then send it to the server

input page:
show message when needing to select a threat, track, or time
fix size and alignment of ok/cancel buttons in modal
threat input: disallow multiple threats at same time in same zone
tweak time-appears - add label, switch to dropdown?

input-> resolution transition:
send over colors from server, with indicies

resolution:
add 'back' button
auto-resolution: disable auto-resolution buttons when ineffective?
add animations?
show player status - knocked out, poisoned, infected
show all specialization buffs and abilities - special shield, spec ops buff, mechanic buff, etc
fix lines in UI when screen resizes
future: handle 4+ simultaneous threats in zone (lines will break if scrolls)
split standard zone into two directives for upper and lower
  disrupted optics
  breached airlocks
  ineffective shields (from reversed shields)
  reversed shields
    fissure x and y damage debuffs
  show irreparable malfunction

support for tutorials

threat impl's:
cryoshield?
ShieldVulnerableToPulse
polarized
swarm (max damage per turn)
canBeKnockedOffCourse
stealth?
decoy
cannotBeTargetedByX - rockets, heavy lasers
eatsShield
megashield
asteroid (attack = breakpoints)
slowed by damage
attack equal to shields?
jump
megashield
speeds up
untargetable @ distance 3

phasing (via Core class)
plasmatic (via damage type)
reduced by 2 vs interceptors (via damage type)
double damage through shields (via damage type)
bonus threats (via interface)
ignore shields (via damage type)
threat buffs (via threat buff on threat controller)


action types to log:

attack x (guns)
attack x (crash)
attack x (claws)
repair
player moves
player uses a/b/c
threat takes damage / reduced by shield
ship takes damage
ship loses shield
speeds up
slows down
gains shield
loses shield


concrete threat dependencies on ThreatController:

external threat + marauder + scout: CurrentExternalThreatBuffs, addexternalthreateffect, removeexternalthreateffectforsource
overlord: damageableexternalthreats (could be changed to just something like repairAllExternalThreats)
leviathan tanker: damageableexternalthreats (could be changed to just something like damageExternalThreats)
transmitter sattelite + Hidden transmitter + scout: moveexternalthreats, moveExternalThreatsInZone, moveinternalthreats
EnergySnake + EnergyDragon + Nemesis: DamageResolutionEnding event
Jumper + Leaper: ExternalTracks
sealed capusle + overlord + TransmitterSatellite + hidden transmitter + spacetimevortex: addinternalthreat, addexternalthreat (for reals)
ninja + slime + cybergremlin + rabid beast: addinternalthreat, addexternalthreat (pseudo-threat)
dimensionspider + cyber gremlin: jumpingtohyperspace event
ReversedShields + BattleBotUprising + PowerPackOverload + PowerSystemOverload: PlayerActionsEnding event
slime: DamageableInternalThreats (to check for spreading, can't spread where already spread)
