Rule clarifications:
Leviathan Tanker with Phasing threats:  assuming they are not damaged
Battlebots Uprising z action with a player in space: assuming not hit
Damage resolution: assuming simultaneous (and therefore a swarm may be hit on same turn as Tanker dies, regardless of ordering)
Always allowing Variable-Range Interceptors
Nemesis crossing an X that will kill it and a Y on the same turn - ??
Ninja drones with a breached airlock - does it get to send them out - ??
Heroic actions using and/or occupying gravolifts - ?? (right now it does neither)
Shield interaction with scout - assuming it modifies 'base shields' and therefore maelstrom-family still has 1 shield when hit by pulse
Reversed shields Y action with destroyer - assuming the shield's portion of the damage is doubled as well
